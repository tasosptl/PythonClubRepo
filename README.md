# Challenges
Challenges for Python Club members are set on a regular basis.  Each challenge has its own directory which appears in the root of the repository; the first of which was aptly name ```challenge1```.  A single **.py_** file consisting of only a docstring of the challenge instructions features in each directory.  This can be used as a template for the solution.

## Official Solutions

Once an official solution is available it will be placed in the ```solutions``` directory with the suffix **_official_solution.py**.  For example, the solution for the first challenge is contained within ```challenge1/solutions/download_speed_official_solution.py```.
