Write a 1-player 'dice roll' game.

The game should do the following:
(1) Prompt the user to choose a number
(2) Validate that the user’s choice is valid on a 6 sided dice
(3) Roll the dice and keep repeating the roll until the user’s guess is correct
(4) Advise the user of how many rolls it took and congratulate them if it was
    a better than average performance
