"""
Write a 1-player 'dice roll' game.

The game should do the following:
(1) Prompt the user to choose a number
(2) Validate that the userâ€™s choice is valid on a 6 sided dice
(3) Roll the dice and keep repeating the roll until the userâ€™s guess is correct
(4) Advise the user of how many rolls it took and congratulate them if it was
    a better than average performance

# The probability of a single roll being right is the chance of it matching the

# in rolls is the sum of :
#   - The probability of getting it on roll 1
#   - The probability of getting it on roll 2 (not getting it on roll 1 AND getting it on roll 2)
# Written mathematically:
#   1/6 + 5/6 * 1/6
# For an arbitrary number of rolls this is can be calculated using this loop:
p = 0
